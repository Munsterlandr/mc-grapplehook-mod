# Movement Additions (name not final)
A mod focused around grappling hooks, and some other additions as well.
This is planned to be for fabric, and so shouldn't be too annoying to bring to new versions.

Tbh I may just end up not working on this because no motivation BUT I have some ideas:
## 1. The Grappling hook
The mechanics of how to swing are going to be more like Verlet Swing or A Story About My Uncle. I do plan on adding a biome or structure or something that's great for this. They will have some part-based durability stuff, but most of the crafting of them will be via crafting tables.

## 2. Yeeter(s)
Big spinny, rocket, giant slingshot? May be interesting.

## 3. Easier Clutch Thing
Fall dmg will be an issue, but just plain "no fall dmg armor" is kinda boring. Instead of that, I think I'll add armor that clutches for you, but with some drawbacks (single use water clutch boots and cobweb boots come to mind).

## 4. Parachute
Feels more reasonable than just no fall dmg, but also stuff like gliders may work.

Of course, these are just ideas so ye
